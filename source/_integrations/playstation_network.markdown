The PlayStation Network {% term integration %} enables you to seamlessly integrate information from your currently playing game in Home Assistant.

## About PlayStation Network

PlayStation Network (PSN) is a digital media entertainment service provided by [Sony Interactive Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment). It allows users to enjoy a variety of gaming-related services such as purchasing games, downloading content, and connecting with other players.

## How you can use this integration

The PlayStation Network integration lets you integrate information about your currently playing game into Home Assistant. You can display the game title and cover art in your Home Assistant dashboards.

## Prerequisites for PlayStation Network integration

- To set up the PlayStation Network integration, you must first have an active PlayStation Network account. You can register for an account at the [Official PlayStationÂ® Site](https://playstation.com/).
- During the setup process in Home Assistant, you will be asked to provide your NPSSO token. You will need to be logged into [playstation.com](https://playstation.com/) to access the token in your browser. You will find a link to retrieve the token in the config flow.

## Supported Functionality

### Media Players

- **PlayStation Console**: One Media Player will be created for any PlayStation 5 and one Media Player will be created for any PlayStation 4 console you have connected to the PlayStation Network. The artwork and title of the currently playing game will be populated.

## Data updates

This integration retrieves data from the PlayStation Network every 30 seconds to ensure timely updates.

## Known limitations

PlayStation Network imposes a rate limit of 300 requests per 15 minutes.

This integration makes 3 requests per data update (every 30 seconds). This presently is well under the rate limit, but leaves room to add additional requests as the integration develops.

Please keep these limits in mind to avoid exceeding the PlayStation Network request allowance.

The Active state for each device is only reported via the API for the last used device. For example, if you start playing a game on your PS4 and without powering down, launch a game on your PS5, the API will only report your PS5 status.

## Supported devices

The following devices are known to be supported by the integration:

- PlayStation 5
- PlayStation 4

## Unsupported devices

The following devices are not supported by the integration:

- PlayStation 3
- PlayStation Vita
- PlayStation Portable
- Other PlayStation system variants (PlayStation TV) or older systems that do not support the PlayStation Network

## Use Cases

You can display your currently playing game as artwork on your dashboard. You can also send notifications of your currently playing game to others inviting them to join you.

## Remove integration

This integration can be removed by following these steps:
